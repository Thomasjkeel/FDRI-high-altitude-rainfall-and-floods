# FDRI-high-altitude-rainfall-and-floods
Examples comparing the proportion of rain falling at given altitudes during/before flood events in FDRI catchments (Severn and Tweed).

## Severn catchment
[Bewdley](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/54001) (gauge height: 18.8 m) is used as the main catchment

Compared with three high altitude sites: [Abermule](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/54014) (86.8 m), [Dolwen](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/54080) (147.3 m) and [Plynlimon Flume](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/54022) (321.3 m).

Rainfall falling -10 to 0 days before event is considered

Compared with two high altitude sites: [Fruid Water](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/21001) (297.5 m) and [Kingledores](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/data/station/info/21014) (214.1 m).

# Disclaimer
The analysis here should be taken with a pinch of salt.  
The resolution of both the rainfall data (from HadUK-Grid) and orography/height data is 1km by 1km. Each gauge is river-side i.e. often at the bottom of a valley.  
*Meaning:* This makes it difficult to know the proportion of the rain falling above the height of the NRFA gauge. Instead, it is important to examine the profile of the rainfall data i.e. a disproportionate amount of rain falls at altitudes higher than the NRFA gauges.
